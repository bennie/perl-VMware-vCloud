              VMware::vCloud - Interface to the VMware vCloud API

WARNING: This fork is incompatible with original VMware::vCloud, as it uses 
only "id" as XML key to convert data tree into perl hash. Not implicit set of 
"name, key, id" (in that order). Name may not be unique and returned datasets 
contains overwritten data. Due to this change, many API call wrappers will 
fail, without prior adjusting to either work with "id" identifier, or handling 
received ARRAYREF instead of HASHREF (in case of missing "id", no associative 
array is created).
