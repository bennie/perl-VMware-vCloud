              VMware::vCloud - Interface to the VMware vCloud API

WARNING: This fork is incompatible with VMware::vCloud, as it uses only "id" as 
XML key, not default set of "name, key, id" (in that order). Name may not be 
unique and returned datasets contain overwritten data. Due to this change, many
API call wrappers will fail, without prior adjusting to either work with "id"
identifier, or handling received ARRAYREF instead of HASHREF (in case of
missing "id", no grouping is done).
