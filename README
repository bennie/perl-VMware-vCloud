              VMware::vCloud - Interface to the VMware vCloud API

===============================================================================
SYNOPSIS:
===============================================================================

  VMware::vcloud provides a programattical interface to vCloud API provided
  for the automation and control of VMware's vCloud Director product.

===============================================================================
END OF LIFE NOTICE:
===============================================================================

VMware marked vCloud Director as "End of Availability" on March 12, 2015.
(This was as part of vCloud Suite 6. The standalone vCloud Director was EOA
in September 2013.)

Correspondingly, this module will likely see no further development.

===============================================================================
COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
===============================================================================

This fork is incompatible with original VMware::vCloud, as it uses only "id" as
the XML key to convert its data tree into a perl hash. Not the implicit set of
"name, key, id" (in that order). Name may not be unique and returned datasets
can contain overwritten data when used. Due to this change, many API call
wrappers will  fail, without prior adjusting to either work with "id" identifier,
or handling received ARRAYREF instead of HASHREF (in case of missing "id",
no associative array is created).

If you wish to avoid this compatibility change, use release 2.402

===============================================================================
