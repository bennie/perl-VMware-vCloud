Revision history for VMware::vCloud

VERSIONTAG DATETAG

  Added:
    Caching of data with Cache::Bounded.
  
  Improved:
    examples/list-vms.pl - Removed commented-out code from 1.x version.


2.01 2011/09/30

  This is a major change in philosophy. Previously this module emulated the API
  in the name of method and returned data structures.

  This does not match most conceptual and desired usage for automation. People
  do not "think" in a collection of REST API calls. They think in actions like
  "deploy a VM."

  Consequently I have moved the direct API implementation to 
  VMware::API::vCloud. It offers an unadulterated pure-perl based view of the
  API and its transactions.

  In VMware::vCloud, I am going to try and present a more human friendly view.

  Added:
    lib/VMware/API/vCloud.pm - Raw API calls and returns.

  Fixed:
    Session ID is now handled via HTTP header, not cookies. This matches the published API docs.
